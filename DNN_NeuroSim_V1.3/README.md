# DNN+NeuroSim V1.3

The DNN+NeuroSim framework was developed by [Prof. Shimeng Yu's group](https://shimeng.ece.gatech.edu/) (Georgia Institute of Technology). The model is made publicly available on a non-commercial basis.

:star2: This is the released version 1.3 (Mar 22, 2021) for the tool, and this version has **_improved following inference engine estimation_**:
```
1. Validate with real silicon data.
2. Add synchronous and asynchronous mode.
3. Update technology file for FinFET.
4. Add level shifter for eNVM.
```
:point_right: :point_right: :point_right: **In "Param.cpp", to switch mode:**
```
validated = true;           // false: no calibration factor     // true: validated by silicon data
synchronous = true;         // false: asynchronous    	        // true: synchronous, clkFreq decided by sensing delay
```
:star2: This version has also added **_three default examples for quick start_**:
```
1. VGG8 on cifar10 
   8-bit "WAGE" mode pretrained model is uploaded to './log/VGG8.pth'
3. DenseNet40 on cifar10 
   8-bit "WAGE" mode pretrained model is uploaded to './log/DenseNet40.pth'
5. ResNet18 on imagenet 
   "FP" mode pretrained model is loaded from 'https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-5c106cde.pth'
```
:point_right: :point_right: :point_right: **To quickly start inference estimation of default models (skip training)**
```
python inference.py --dataset cifar10 --model VGG8 --mode WAGE
python inference.py --dataset cifar10 --model DenseNet40 --mode WAGE
python inference.py --dataset imagenet --model ResNet18 --mode FP
```

**_For estimation of on-chip training accelerators, please visit released V2.1 [DNN+NeuroSim V2.1](https://github.com/neurosim/DNN_NeuroSim_V2.1)_**

In Pytorch/Tensorflow wrapper, users are able to define **_network structures, precision of synaptic weight and neural activation_**. With the integrated NeuroSim which takes real traces from wrapper, the framework can support hierarchical organization from device level to circuit level, to chip level and to algorithm level, enabling **_instruction-accurate evaluation on both accuracy and hardware performance of inference_**.
